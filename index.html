              <h2 class="who-is-he">Who's this Joe Fella?</h2>
              <p> "Meet Joe, a man of many talents and even more attrocities. With a penchant for Hawaiian shirts, mismatched socks and women's underwear, he's never one to blend in with the crowd. His hobbies include collecting rubber ducks and practicing his ukulele skills, which are questionable at best. He's also a self-proclaimed professional napper, able to doze off in any situation. But don't let his quirks fool you, he's a kind-hearted soul and always up for an adventure, even if it's just a trip to the local convenience store."            </p>
              <p> He is well known in Birmingham for his ability to dance like it's 1985. He often receives standing ovations from his good "friend" (and lover) Jerry </P>
              <p> In his spare time, he enjoys feeding the ducks down at the local park and reading the literature of Karl Marx (<strong> he is a well known communist sympathizer </strong>) </p>

                    <p> <em>He's got a unique set of skills that rival even the most eccentric of characters. Joe is a competitive yo-yoer, and spends most of his free time perfecting his craft.
